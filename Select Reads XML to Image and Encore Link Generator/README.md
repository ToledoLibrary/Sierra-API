Using PHP, this webpage will generate a list of Encore and Content Cafe image links using Select Reads XML and querying the Sierra API.

The use-case scenario was to be able to provide an easy method for staff to populate the Communico widget that appears on the primary library website.

It is necessary to use encoded Sierra API credentials. Please refer to Sierra documentation "Getting Started with the Sierra API" for more information.

Four Xs (XXXX) appear in place of text (such as API credentials, library-specific URLs) that should be customized.
