Using PHP, jQuery, the Sierra API and Content Cafe, this website will generate HTML code to display a list of book jackets in a wide variety of formats based on user input.

The user can select the image size, the number of columns, and whether to include the catalog summary.

The code is then easily copied and can be pasted in the user's content management system.

Please note that the CSS located in the imagestyles.css must be added to the website on which the code will be displayed.

It is necessary to use encoded Sierra API credentials. Please refer to Sierra documentation "Getting Started with the Sierra API" for more information.

Four Xs (XXXX) appear in place of text (such as API credentials, library-specific URLs) that should be customized.

Use at your own risk. Not supported by the Toledo Lucas County Public Library.
